            <h5>First time</h5>
            <p>I got introduced to computer science after a critical major change</p>
            <p>I switched from engineering to computer science and i did not have it easy</p>
            <p>My introduction to coding class was a wreck which prompted a fail and retake course</p>
            <p>I almost gave up.My first programming lecture was on python and sitting here writing this post,
               I can testify that i have come a long way, really long way. </p>
            <p>Programming is like a second life skill,you practice in and out to build up your foundation</p>
            <p>You take pride in the small joy of your code working, also of how you can build up a solution
                to a problem, no matter how small</p>

            <h5> Acquaintance</h5>
            <p>As classes go on, i made study partners, youtube tutorials became my bestfriend</p>
            <p>I have been able to build up on my foundation on Java, mySQL ,Microsoft excel and python</p>
            <p>That is not a lot, but it good to master a few languages than be all over the place</p>
            <p>Step by step,by projectwise, i begin to pick up few skills and see if i can try task on the internet</p>
            <p>Not a really good result, because it humbles you so more room for improvement</p>
