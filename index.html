    <h3>MY FIRST LAB(c-VANESSA)</h3>
    <p>Hello my name is Vanessa Bedzra,I am a Ghanaian and a junior at Ashesi University studying Computer Science </p>
    <p>If you were to ask what my major is about,I would just give a vague answer.</p>
    <p>Because it is everything,related to </p>
    <p>technology in and out, what service you use to call, access the internet and more</p>
    <p>It's around you. That the feeling i have about my major and it is okay to feel</p>
    <p>clueless about it</p>
    <p>I would be graduating in 2022, really nervous about. I might see this later in years</p>
    <p>and laugh at myself but i hope for a great path ahead</p>
    <p>l like reading novels, watching horror movies and coding around.</p>
